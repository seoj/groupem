    <h1>Groupem!</h1>
    
    <p>Calculates groups of people such that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>each group does not exceed in number of people the given value; and,</li>
        <li>no two person in the same exclusion group exist in the same group</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ex. You want to create groups such that couples are always separated. Jane and Bob are couples. Then the group will be something like Jane,Bill and Joe,Bob. The group will never be Jane,Bob and Bill,Joe.</p>
    <p>Please note that certain parameters will not yield any results because either there is no possible groups or the calculation timed out. Try 2 or 3 times before giving up.</p>
